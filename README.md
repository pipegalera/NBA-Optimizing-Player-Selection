# NBA_Scrappers

The repository includes the 5 Scrappers for extracting the advanced stats of teams and players
of the NBA. For NBA.com I used Selenium and for Basketball Reference BeautifulSoup. The project
is only for academic purpose and not intended to make any personal or monetary profit out of it.

The py files are named according to the purpose:

 - BR: From the webpage Basketballreference.com
 - NBA: From the webpage NBA.com
 - PS: Stands for Player Statistics
 - TS: Stands for Team Statistics

 For example, NBA_PS Scrapper.py is the scrapper of NBA.com of the player statistics.
